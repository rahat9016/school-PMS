      "The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB DP) was established in Geneva in 1968 to provide an international, and internationally recognized, university-entrance qualification for students studying outside of their home country. The IB’s goal is to provide students with the values and opportunities that will enable them to develop sound judgments make wise choices, and respect others in the global community. The IB Programme equips students with the skills and attitudes necessary for success in higher education and employment; it has the strengths of a traditional liberal arts curriculum, but with three important additional features, shown at the center of the hexagonal curriculum model (below). Today the IB DP has expanded so that more than half the students opting for it come from state or national systems rather than from international schools. As the IB DP has grown, so too has its reputation for excellence; the IB DP is now recognized in almost every country in the world as one of the pre-eminent pre-university qualifications.",

As well as considering their personal strengths in individual subjects, when making course selections students should also take into account their future education and career plans. Students should become familiar with the specific requirements of the universities in the countries to which they intend to apply as different universities in different countries have different entrance requirements. It is very important that you are aware that specific subjects or combinations of subjects could be required (or excluded) by the country or university of your choice. Information about universities around the world is available from PAIS’s college counselor. It is strongly recommended that students spend as much time as possible discussing their options with as many people as possible, including parents and teachers. Decisions made at this stage in a student’s education could affect the rest of their lives, so it is vital that choices are made only after full research and consultation. To be eligible for the IB Diploma, each student is required to follow six IB courses, with one subject taken from each group in the curriculum model:",
