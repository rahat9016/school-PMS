              At Pan-Asia International School, school counselors are friendly
              adults who are professionally trained to actively listen to
              concerns of students, parents, teachers, and school
              administrators. Within their competence, our school counselors
              provide guidance lessons, individual counseling, and build a
              referral network of community resources for students. Besides,
              they help teachers, parents, and school administrators have better
              understanding of studentâ€™s challenges and needs. From this
              understanding, we build a strong team to provide the best support
              for our students.
