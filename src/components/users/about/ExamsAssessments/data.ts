      "Each school year, students in KG3 to Grade 11 take the tests in August, October and March. The first testing aims to determine the students’ current level so that we can work to improve until the next testing period. Following each testing period, parents will receive a report showing the students’ growth.",
    desc2: "We give students MAP tests to determine your child’s instructional level and to measure academic growth throughout the school year, and from year to year in the areas of Reading, Language Usage, Math and Science.",
    desc3:"When taking the MAP test, the difficulty of each question is based on how well a student answers all the previous questions. As the student answers correctly, questions become more difficult. If the student answers incorrectly, the questions become easier. Although the tests are not timed, it usually takes students about one hour to complete each test.",

      "No. This assessment is designed to target a student’s academic performance in mathematics, reading, language usage and science. These tests are tailored to an individual’s current achievement level. This gives each student a fair opportunity to show what he or she knows and can do. Because the computer adjusts the difficulty of the questions as the test progresses, each student takes a unique test.",

      "MAP is used to measure a student’s progress or growth in school. The testing information is important to teachers because it indicates a student’s strengths are and help that is needed in any specific areas. Teachers can use this information to help them guide instruction in the classroom. How can parents help the students to prepare for MAP testing?",

      "Provide a comfortable, quiet place for studying at home.",
      "Make sure that your child is well-rested on school days, especially the day of the test. Children who are tired are less able to pay attention in class or to handle the demands of a test.",
      "Give your child a well-rounded diet. A healthy body leads to a healthy, active mind.",
      "Provide books and magazines for your child to read at home. By reading new material, a child learns new words that might appear on a test. Ask your child’s teacher for a suggested reading list."
